# Delphi Then

- In 2012, we formed [Delphi](https://delphi.cmu.edu) to "develop the theory and practice of epidemic forecasting, and its role in decision-making"
- Participated in annual CDC flu forecasting challenges since 2013, earned top place in several 
- Awarded `r col("CDC's National Center of Excellence")` for flu forecasting in 2019 
- Published open code and data, including numerous influenza surveillance streams 

# Delphi Now

- We've gone from 7 members to over 40, to support the US COVID-19 response
- Added many smart folks from CMU, but also Stanford, UC Davis, USC, Google
- Beyond (before?) forecasting: we've been focusing, now more than ever, on `r col("data")`
- *This problem is so hard that our best weapon is a diversity of data sources*

# COVIDcast Indicators

![](covidcast_indicators.svg)

# What Can This Be Used For?

- Forecasting, e.g.
    * Case incidence: for vaccine trial site selection
    * Hospitalizations: for planning and preparedness 
- Nowcasting, e.g.,
    * Situational awareness: testing and resource allocation
    * Decision-making: re-opening criteria, school closures
 - General epidemiological research, e.g.,
    * What behaviors are linked to spread?
    * What symptoms are linked to cases?

# This Talk

I can't cover all of this! I'll focus on our API, and some basic demos with our survey data (please ask about `r col("medical claims data")`, or ask about forecasting or nowcasting, during the Q & A)

Outline:

1. COVIDcast API
2. Symptom survey
3. Forecasting demo

`r col("Reproducible talk:")` all code included

# COVIDcast API 

The COVIDcast API is based on HTTP GET queries and returns data in JSON form. The base URL is https://api.covidcast.cmu.edu/epidata/api.php?source=covidcast 

| Parameter | Description | Examples |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `data_source` | data source | `doctor-visits` or `fb-survey` |
| `signal` | signal derived from data source | `smoothed_cli` or `smoothed_adj_cli` |
| `time_type` | temporal resolution of the signal | `day` or `week` |
| `geo_type` | spatial resolution of the signal | `county`, `hrr`, `msa`, or `state` |
| `time_values` | time units over which events happened | `20200406` or `20200406-20200410` |
| `geo_value` | location codes, depending on `geo_type` | `*` for all, or `pa` for Pennsylvania |

# R and Python Packages

We also provide [R](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/covidcast/covidcastR/) and [Python](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/covidcast/covidcast-py/html/) packages for API access. Highlights: 

- Easy API querying:
    * Same specification structure (many default parameters) 
    * Full support for data revisions (as of, issues, lag)
- Basic signal processing:
    * Correlations sliced by location, or by time
    * Data wrangling: preparing signals for analysis
- Plotting functionality:
    * Choropleth and bubble maps 
    * Time series plots

# Example: Deaths

How many COVID-19 deaths have been reported per day, in my state, since March 1?

```{r, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 5.5}
library(covidcast)
start_day = "2020-03-01"
end_day = "2021-01-16"

     range = c(0, 10000), 
     choro_params = list(subtitle = end_day_str, legend_n = 6))
```

# Example: Doctor's Visits

How do some cities compare in terms of doctor's visits due to COVID-like illness?

```{r, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 6}

  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 month", date_labels = "%b") +
  scale_color_hue(labels = cbsa_to_name(unique(dv$geo_value)))
```

# Example: Symptoms

```{r, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 6}
sympt = covidcast_signal(data_source = "fb-survey", 
                         signal = "smoothed_hh_cmnty_cli",
                         start_day = "2020-04-15", end_day = end_day,

  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

# As Of, Issues, Lag

By default the API returns the most recent data for each `time_value`. We also provide access to all previous versions of the data, using the following optional parameters:

| Parameter | To get data ... | Examples |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `as_of` | as if we queried the API on a particular date | `20200406` |
| `issues` | published at a particular date or date range | `20200406` or `20200406-20200410` |
| `lag` | published a certain number of time units after events occured | `1` or `3` |

# Data Revisions 

Why would we need this? Because many data sources are subject to `r col("revisions:")`

- Case and death counts frequently corrected/adjusted by authorities
- Medical claims data can take weeks to be submitted and/or processed
- Testing/lab data can be backlogged for a variety of reasons, etc.

This presents a challenge to modelers: e.g., we have to learn how to forecast based on the `r col("data we'd have at the time")`, not updates that would arrive later

To accommodate, we log revisions even when the original data source does not!

# Example: Backfill in Doctor's Visits

```{r, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 5}
# Let's get the data that was available as of 09/22, for the end of August in CA

**Part 2: Symptom Surveys** </div>

# Massive Symptom Survey

Through recruitment partnership with Facebook, we survey about `r col("50,000 people daily")` (and over 16 million since it began in April), in the US. Topics include:

- COVID symptoms (common and rare)
- COVID testing
- Mental health
- Social contacts and behavior
- Demographics

A [parallel, international effort](https://covidmap.umd.edu/) by the University of Maryland reaches 100+ countries in 55 languages

# Massive Symptom Survey (Cont.)

- The survey is implemented on Qualtrics, managed by CMU
- Facebook never receives any individual responses
- Designed to take about 10 minutes; about 35 questions
- Questions originally motivated by relevance to forecasting and nowcasting
- But also for research in public health (understanding the pandemic burden)
- Respondents provide ZIP code, so data is available at county level

This is the largest non-Census research survey `r col("ever conducted")` (that we know of). Raw response data is freely available to researchers who sign a [data use agreement](https://dataforgood.fb.com/docs/covid-19-symptom-survey-request-for-data-access/)

# COVID-Like Illness

Using the survey data we generate daily, county-level estimates of:

- `r col("% CLI:")` the percentage of people with COVID-like illness
- `r col("% CLI-in-community:")` the percentage of people who know someone in their local community with COVID-like illness

(Note that COVID-like illness or CLI is defined as *fever of at least 100 °F, along with cough, shortness of breath, or difficulty breathing*. We also ask people to report on more rare symptoms)

# Why % CLI-in-Community? 

Why ask a proxy question (have people report on others)? Here's Spearman correlations to COVID-19 case rates:

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5}
# Fetch Facebook % CLI signal, % CLI-in-community signal and confirmed case
# incidence proportions
start_day = "2020-04-15"
end_day = "2021-01-16"
sympt1 = covidcast_signal("fb-survey", "smoothed_cli", 
                          start_day, end_day)
sympt2 = covidcast_signal("fb-survey", "smoothed_hh_cmnty_cli", 
                          start_day, end_day)
cases = covidcast_signal("usa-facts", "confirmed_7dav_incidence_prop", 
                         start_day, end_day)

# Consider only counties with at least 500 cumulative cases so far
case_num = 500
geo_values = covidcast_signal("usa-facts", "confirmed_cumulative_num",
                              max(cases$time), max(cases$time)) %>%
  filter(value >= case_num) %>% pull(geo_value)
sympt1_act = sympt1 %>% filter(geo_value %in% geo_values)
sympt2_act = sympt2 %>% filter(geo_value %in% geo_values)
cases_act = cases %>% filter(geo_value %in% geo_values)

# Compute correlations, per time, over all counties
df_cor1 = covidcast_cor(sympt1_act, cases_act, by = "time_value", 
                        method = "spearman")
df_cor2 = covidcast_cor(sympt2_act, cases_act, by = "time_value", 
                        method = "spearman")

# Stack rowwise into one data frame
df_cor = rbind(df_cor1, df_cor2)
df_cor$signal = c(rep("% CLI", nrow(df_cor1)), 
                  rep("% CLI-in-community", nrow(df_cor2)))

# Then plot correlations over time 
ggplot(df_cor, aes(x = time_value, y = value)) + 
  geom_line(aes(color = signal)) +
  labs(title = "Correlation between survey signals and case rates (by time)",
       subtitle = sprintf("Over all counties with at least %i cumulative cases",
                          case_num), x = "Date", y = "Correlation") +
    theme_bw() + theme(legend.pos = "bottom", legend.title = element_blank())
```

# Beyond Symptom Data

Reminder: survey data extends far beyond symptoms. For example:

- Test positivity rate, broken down by test reason
- % of people tested in last 14 days, broken down by age, occupation
- % of people *ever* tested
- Types of activities people do outside their homes
- Mask wearing, reporting on self/others in community
- Anxiety, depression, isolation
- Willingness to accept a COVID-19 vaccine

# Example: Vaccine Acceptance

If a COVID-19 vaccine were offered to you today, would you definitely or probably get vaccinated?

```{r, fig.width = 9, fig.height = 7}
start_day = "2021-01-18"
end_day = "2021-01-18"
vaccine = covidcast_signal(data_source = "fb-survey",
                           signal = "smoothed_waccept_covid_vaccine",
                           start_day, end_day, geo_type = "state")

plot(vaccine, title = "% of people who would accept COVID-19 vaccine",
     range = c(50, 85), choro_col = c("#D9F0C2", "#BFE6B5", "#1F589F"),
     choro_params = list(subtitle = format.Date(end_day, "%B %d %Y")))

# An Early Indicator?

As motivation, let's take a look at case counts in Miami-Dade, right around the second wave:

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5}

# An Early Indicator? (Cont.) 

Let's look again, now at Allegheny County, right around the third wave:

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5}
start_day = "2020-10-15"
end_day = "2020-12-01"
sympt = covidcast_signal("fb-survey", "smoothed_hh_cmnty_cli", 
                         start_day, end_day)
cases = covidcast_signal("usa-facts", "confirmed_7dav_incidence_num",
                         start_day, end_day)

# Produce a plot for Allegheny County, and add vertical lines
plot_one(name_to_fips("Allegheny"), df1 = sympt, df2 = cases,
         lab1 = "% CLI-in-community", lab2 = "New COVID-19 cases", 
         xlab = "Date", ylab1 = "New COVID-19 cases",
         ylab2 = "% of people who know someone with CLI") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = as.numeric(as.Date("2020-10-30")),
             linetype = 2, size = 1, color = ggplot_colors[1]) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = as.numeric(as.Date("2020-11-06")),
             linetype = 2, size = 1, color = ggplot_colors[2])
```

# Simple Forecasting Demo

Notational setup: for location $\ell$ and time $t$, let

- $Y_{\ell,t}$ denote the COVID-19 case incidence rate
- $X_{\ell,t}$ the % CLI-in-community signal

To predict case rates $d$ days ahead, consider two `r col("simple autoregressive models:")`
$$
\begin{align*}
\mathrm{Quantile}_\tau(Y_{\ell,t+d} \,|\, \{Y_s,X_s:s\leq t\}) &=
\alpha_\tau + \sum_{j=0}^2 \beta_{\tau,j} Y_{\ell,t-7j} \\
\mathrm{Quantile}_\tau(Y_{\ell,t+d} \,|\, \{Y_s,X_s:s\leq t\}) &=
\alpha_\tau + \sum_{j=0}^2 \beta_{\tau,j} Y_{\ell,t-7j} + 
\sum_{j=0}^2 \beta_{\tau,j} X_{\ell,t-7j}\\
\end{align*}
$$

# Simple Forecasting Demo (Cont.)

- Fit models using quantile regression at levels 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, ... 0.9, 0.95, 0.975, 0.99
- For each forecast date, train on most recent 21 days of data (to account for `r col("nonstationarity")`)
- Use noncrossing constraints (enforce noncrossing of quantiles at both training and test points)
- Recast quantiles as prediction intervals $(\ell_i,u_i)$, $i=0,\ldots,k$. Given a forecast distribution $F$, with:
$$
\ell_i = F^{-1}(\alpha_i/2), \; u_i = F^{-1}(1-\alpha_i/2), \; i=0,\ldots,k 
$$
and target $y$, we score forecasts using weighted interval score or WIS: 
$$
\mathrm{WIS}(P,y) = \frac{1}{2(k+1)} \sum_{i=0}^k \Big[\alpha_i(u_i-\ell_i) + 2 \cdot \mathrm{dist}(y,[\ell_i,u_i])\Big]
$$
This is a negatively oriented (lower is better) scoring rule, combining coverage and sharpness

# Wrapping Up

Delphi's COVIDcast ecosystem has many parts:

1. Unique relationships with partners in tech and healthcare granting us access to data on pandemic activity
2. Code and infrastructure to build `r col("COVID-19 indicators")`, continuously-updated and geographically-comprehensive
3. A historical database of all indicators, including `r col("revision tracking")`
4. A [public API](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast.html) (and [R](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/covidcast/covidcastR/) and [Python](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/covidcast/covidcast-py/html/) packages) serving new indicators daily 
5. [Interactive maps and graphics](https://covidcast.cmu.edu) to display our indicators
6. Nowcasting and forecasting work building on the indicators

In this pandemic, it'll take an entire community to find answers to all the important questions. Please join ours!

# Medical Insurance Claims

Through partnership with Change Healthcare and others, we compute daily, county-level aggregate statistics from medical insurance claims covering `r col("over half of the US population")`

- We construct various outpatient and inpatient signals, using rules based on ICD-10 codes 
- For example: `r col("% CLI-in-doctor-visits")` = 100 * (COVID-like + Flu-like + Mixed - Flu) / Total
- Available at about 3-5 day latency, with huge backfill tendency (substantial for several weeks out)
- Exhibit puzzling spatial bias ... % CLI-in-doctor-visits not directly comparable across the US

Despite challenges, these data have enormous potential for `r col("nowcasting")`. Why? Can help overcome major issues with public health reporting: limited testing capacity, reporting artifacts, retroactive re-definitions ... 

<br>

And can help overcome by far the biggest problem: `r col("misleading/misinterpreted aggregation rules")`, e.g., cases are timestamped based on report date, *not* test date!
